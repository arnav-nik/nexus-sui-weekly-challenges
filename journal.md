# Arnav Nikam Sui Weekly Challenge Dev Journal

## Challenge 0
1. Being a part of the workshop was really helpful to ensure everything was downloaded correctly
2. I'm using WSL on VSCode, so everything is pretty much setup
3. Had setup a client in the past so this wasn't too bad
4. Tried using sui client faucet command, but ended up not working, went to web faucet instead:https://faucet.sui.io/. Everything worked fine! 
5. Liked the use of creating a sword for creating smart contracts, I feel like I have a new dev weapon!
6. Had some errors because I am using WSL and had to work some things around, eventually got it in the end

# Summary
Overall, had a decent time following the tutorial, I ran into some hiccups along the way but it was most due to environment setup which I needed to fix on my computer. Sui's developer tools are really easy to use, which I definitely enjoy!
